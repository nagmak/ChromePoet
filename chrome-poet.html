    <div>"I must not fear.<br>
        Fear is the mind-killer.<br>
        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br>
        I will face my fear.<br>
        I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br>
        And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br>
        Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
