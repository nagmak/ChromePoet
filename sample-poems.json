      "My heart\’s aflutter\!\n
      I am standing in the bath tub\n
      crying. Mother, mother\n
      who am I? If he\n
      will just come back once\n
      and kiss me on the face\n
      his coarse hair brush\n
      my temple, it’s throbbing!\n\n

      then I can put on my clothes\n
      I guess, and walk the streets.\n"
