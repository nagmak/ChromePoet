    "Now I am quietly waiting for\n
    the catastrophe of my personality\n
    to seem beautiful again,\n
    and interesting, and modern.\n\n

    The country is grey and\n
    brown and white in trees,\n
    snows and skies of laughter\n
    always diminishing, less funny\n
    not just darker, not just grey.\n\n

    It may be the coldest day of\n
    the year, what does he think of\n
    that? I mean, what do I? And if I do,\n
    perhaps I am myself again."
